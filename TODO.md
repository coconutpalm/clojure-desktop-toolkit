## This week: Packaging

* `java -jar <jarfile>` while downloading SWT from the internet
* `java -jar <jarfile>` with a `file://` URL to a stripped-down local SWT Maven repo
* Script/build to create a universal release bundle with Win/Lin/Mac JREs included and dynamic artifacts in a local Maven repo

Migrate to a monorepo with CDT in its own dir, the Maven repo update scripts in their own dir, the universal build example in its own dir.

## Add a subproject for custom SWT controls.

* CTabFolderSide - CTabFolder with tabs on the side; other custom things
* Nebula fork?
* E4 controls?
* GEF?

Deploy to Clojars?  My own SWT Maven repo
