# Clojure Desktop Toolkit Tutorial

Start here. 😁

## Introduction

The Eclipse SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit) library, on which the Clojure Desktop Toolkit is based, rigorously adheres to a set of standard naming and usage conventions.  As a result, it is possible to mechanically generate a Clojure API for SWT using Java reflection and Clojure macros at compile time.

This is what the Clojure Desktop Toolkit does; it also makes SWT and Clojure Desktop Toolkit easier to understand by reducing the surface area of things one must remember in order to work effectively.  Everything is a small set of rules and naming conventions.

## Next steps

Let's examine the API and usage more closely.
